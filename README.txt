Hi, this is a simple clone of Pong game.

How to run it?

It is simple, I use Mac OS, but it would work in similar fashion on Linux or
BSD. Issue these commands:

git clone https://github.com/adampaulukanis/pong-clone

# here I use php for serving my html files
php -S localhost:3333

# now point your browser to localhost:3333 and play ;^)
